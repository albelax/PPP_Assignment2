# First Year Programming Assignment
This is a small game that was developed as a first year assignment using the Fixed Function Pipeline of OpenGL (deprecated) and SDL

## Requirements
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)  ( 3.0 ) - used to draw the game
* [SDL 2]( https://www.libsdl.org/ ) - for input and windows
* [Qt]( https://www.qt.io/ ) - QtCreator was my IDE of choice, however Qt libraries were not used in this project 
* GLFunctionsLib - a simple Math library included in the project, **Build this before**
